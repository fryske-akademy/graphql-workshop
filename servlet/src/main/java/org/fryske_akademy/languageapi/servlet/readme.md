This workshop shows a contract first graphql approach using CDI from Java EE.

- write your graphql schema
- generate java pojo's
- extend GraphQLHttpServlet from graphql-kickstart
- write data fetchers

You will learn:

- how to create a schema (https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/schema)
- how to generate code from a schema (https://github.com/kobylynskyi/graphql-java-codegen)
- how to build an executable schema with datafetchers (https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/getting-started)
- how to configure a kickstart servlet (https://www.graphql-java-kickstart.com/servlet/getting-started/)
- how to do instrumentation, error handling and Type resolving (your pojo's to graphql schema objects)
